We will run a query for email field in the users collections to check in how much documents it exists or not

db.users.find({ email: { $exists: 1 } }, {name: 1, _id: 0, email: 1})

this will return documents of 'John Doe', 'Jane Wilson' & 'Bob Smith'
but it will not return the document of 'John Jones' as it doesn't has email field

lets run the same query again but this time lets check the existence of email as false

db.users.find({email: {$exists: 0}}, {name: 1, _id: 0, email: 1})

and as expected it fetches the document (record) of 'John Jones'

**********IMPORTANT**********
true = 1
false = 0
we can use use interchangably 1 or true & 0 or false in the query
