nor simply means not or. Although you need to match one of the qualifers for or operators but in not operator you have to not match both the qualifer
that's when it will fetch result

for example:

db.users.find({ $nor: [ {'name.first': 'John'}, {'name.last': 'Wilson'} ] }, {name: 1, _id: 0})

the above query only fetches the document of bob wilson.

NOR simply means Not OR.
Means opposite of OR.
That's why NOR will fetch all those documents that will not satisfy the condition of OR.

PROOF is simple the copy & paste the same query written above into the terminal and run it.
It will give you the only document of bob wilson but when we just edit the spelling of 
NOR operator to OR( just deleting the N from NOR ) it will fetch the documents of John Doe & Jane Wilson.
