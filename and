lets first insert a document in the users collection

db.users.insert({name: { 'first': 'John', 'last': 'Jones' }})

Now we have four users into the users collection
1. John Doe
2. Jane Wilson
3. Bob Smith
4. John Jones

The and query here is 

db.users.find( { $and: [{'name.first': 'John'}, {'name.last': 'Jones'}] }, {'name.first': 1, 'name.last': 1, _id: 0} )

This query basically fetches only one document.
i.e. John Jones
as the name.first has two options 'John Doe' & 'John Jones'
But since and means both the qualifiers must be true to fetch a document from the collection
thats why the only document we got is of John Jones.
